            <h1>Learning the strokes of tennis</h1>
            <label id="introduction"></label>
            <p>The 8 basic shots in tennis are the serve, return, forehand, backhand, slice, forehand volley, backhand volley, and overhead. Beginners must become comfortable with these 8 shots before they can be considered intermediate players and learning new, advanced skills.</p>
            <p> So why do these names exist? And most importantly, why should you care about them? </p>

            <p> The names of basic tennis shots exist in order to facilitate communication between coaches, players, and tennis fans. They make it much easier for people to understand what they are learning and what they need to do about it. It is just like how we have defined subjects in school, – math, biology, history – technically we don’t need the definition, but it makes understanding a whole lot easier. </p>

         <h2><b>There are 4 key things to keep in mind when hitting a forehand:</b></h2>
         <ol>
            <li><b>Positioning/stance:</b> Typically in the early stages of learning the technique, you would stand perpendicular to the net with your non-dominant shoulder pointed at the net. This is referred to as a “closed stance”. Sometimes, you’ll see pros and other great players hitting forehands with an “open stance” where their body is open and facing the net. Depending on your level, you might hit forehands with either or both type of stance.</li>
           <li><b>Backswing:</b>A proper backswing is really about upper body rotation. Keep in mind that the arm you use to take the racquet back should actually be in harmony with the hips and shoulders turning first. You know you have completed the set-up of the swing properly if your shoulder is closed (with your body facing the side of the court and the shoulder is pointed at the net).</li>
            <li><b>Forward Swing and Contact with the Ball:</b> This part of the swing is all about weight transfer. You’re taking the energy and torque from your backswing (and shoulder and hip turn) and transferring it through the tennis ball and towards your target. A good thing to keep in mind here is that to assist with your weight transfer, you should step towards your target with the non-dominant or opposite foot. For right handers, you would step forward with the left foot. </li>
            <li><b>Follow Through:</b>After you connect with the tennis ball, continue your swing through the ball with the racquet ending up high. There are a few images here that people use which work well: one, you can imagine placing the racquet into your non-dominant hand (or “catching it”) after impact; and/or two, you can imagine scratching your back with your racquet over your non-dominant shoulder after following through. </li>

         <h2><b>Key to hitting the perfect backhand:</b></h2>
         <ol>
            <li><b>Making contact with the ball:</b> Try to make contact with the ball when it is not directly in front of you. If you are right-handed, you should make contact a little off to your left side. The ball should be a little bit in front of you. You should be in a similar position as you would be when turning a doorknob.</li>
 
            <li><b>Racquet-face control:</b> Beginners often struggle with racquet-face control and then lose control of the ball. It is very important to be mindful of how you hold the racquet and how that changes the directions the strings face because wherever your racquet face is pointing the moment that you make contact with the ball, that is where the ball is going to go. When you are just starting out, the goal should be to get the ball in play. As you get a little better, try to get it in but in the direction you are aiming for. So focus on controlling your racquet face and where it is pointing the moment you make contact with the ball.</b>
 
            <li><b>Grip:</b> People can hold a racquet in many ways. In terms of the backhand, this includes hitting a two-handed backhand or a one-handed backhand. And while the two-handed backhand – where the dominant hand is at the bottom of the handle, with the non-dominant hand on top – is more common in today’s game, the most important thing is to use the grip you are most comfortable with and which gives you the most control.
               Ultimately, the way you hold the grip translates to how the racquet face is pointing, so it really doesn’t matter which grip you use as long as you are able to control the racquet face. In terms of holding on to a racquet, it’s important that you aren’t trying to choke the life out of it. In terms of a scale from 1 to 10, if 10 is the absolute tightest you can grip the racquet, you want your grip to be at about a 3.</li>
 
            <li><b>Swing:</b> The harder you swing, the farther the ball is going to go. The most important thing is to be able to keep the ball on the court when you are a beginner, so keeping your backhand swing at a level that you’re able to keep the ball on the court is your No. 1 priority.</b>
 
            <li><b>Footwork:</b> In general, try to be as light on your feet as possible. It shouldn’t sound like a herd of horses on the court when you’re playing.</b>
