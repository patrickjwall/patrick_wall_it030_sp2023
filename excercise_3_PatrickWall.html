    <h2>Ingredients List</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>baking powder</li>
      <li>lemon zest</li>
      <li>salt</li>
      <li>unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease a 9x5-inch (or 8x4-inch) loaf pan.</li>
      <li>In a medium bowl combine the flour, baking powder, lemon zest, and salt. Set aside.</li>
      <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or using an electric mixer), cream the butter and sugar together at medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 4-6 minutes. Scrape the sides of the bowl as needed.</li>
      <li>With the mixer running on low-speed, add the eggs one at a time, then beat in the vanilla extract and lemon juice. Beat on medium-high speed until combined.</li>
      <li>With the mixer on low, add about one-third of the flour mixture and mix until almost combined, then add half the buttermilk and mix until just combined. Repeat with another third of flour mixture and then the last half of the buttermilk, ending with the last third of the flour. Beat until just incorporated.</li>
      <li>Scrape the batter into the prepared loaf pan and bake for 45-55 minutes until the cake is golden brown and a toothpick comes out mostly clean with only a couple moist crumbs. Baking times vary, so keep an eye on yours.</li>
      <li>Let the cake cool for about 15 minutes in the pan. Stir together the lemon juice and confectioners’ sugar for the lemon syrup. Carefully invert the loaf pan, and transfer the cake to a cooling rack, then brush the syrup on the cake while it’s still warm. Allow cake to cool completely.</li>
      <li>When the cake is cooled, combine all the icing ingredients, start with 1 tbsp lemon juice and milk and add the remaining lemon juice as needed. The icing should be thick and not runny. Pour icing over cake and let dry before serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Read more about Lemon Cake</h2>
    <p>Lemon cake is a dense, flavorful and very popular cake. <b>Lemon</b> is used to provide its <i>unique flavor</i> to a variety of cakes, including bundt, angel food or white cakes. However, lemon cake commonly refers to loaf cake with a tighter grain and more elastic crumb, much like a pound cake. <i>The exact origin of lemon cake is unknown</i>. It is probably derived from the <b>pound cake</b>, which was first baked in <i>England</i> around 1700. A pound of each ingredient was used to make a simple, heavy cake to feed large groups of people. A lemon cake can be made with either <i>lemon zest</i> or juice, sometimes both. <b>When making the cake, have all ingredients at room temperature before starting</b>. <i>The creaming method of mixing is commonly used when baking lemon cake</i>.</p>
